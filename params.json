{"name":"Recycle","tagline":"Recycle saves you time by storing your commonly used files and templates for future use","body":"## Stop Repeating Yourself\r\nRecycle is a glorified copy-paste utility for managing commonly-used templates\r\nand boilerplate. After creating a template once, you can save it with Recycle\r\nfor use in the future. Recycle can manage templates for single files or\r\neven entire directory structures.\r\n\r\n### Installation\r\nRecycle can be installed with pip:\r\n\r\n    pip install recycle\r\n\r\nOr by cloning the repo and running\r\n\r\n    python setup.py install\r\n\r\n### Usage\r\n\r\n#### Recycling 101\r\n\r\nTo save some files for later use, simply run\r\n\r\n    re new NAME_OF_TEMPLATE LOCATION/OF/FILES\r\n\r\nSo for example\r\n\r\n    re new MathHomework ~/homework.tex\r\n\r\nWould save the file `homework.tex` under the name \"MathHomework\"\r\nSimilarly,\r\n\r\n    re new WebApp ~/WebAppTemplate/\r\n\r\nWould save all the files and folders within `~/WebAppTemplate` under the name\r\n\"WebApp\"\r\n\r\n**NOTE**: If you try to name something using a name that has already been\r\nassigned, you will be prompted to overwrite the existing files.\r\nThis will completely replace the existing saved files.\r\n\r\n#### Reusing\r\n\r\nTo use an existing template, run\r\n\r\n    re use NAME_OF_TEMPLATE\r\n\r\nThis will copy all of the files associated with that name to the current directory.\r\nFor example, to create a new web app one might use\r\n\r\n    mkdir SuperRadWebApp\r\n    cd SuperRadWebApp\r\n    re use WebApp\r\n\r\nBoom! All your files are magically there. You can get started on the fun stuff.\r\n\r\n#### Listing Saved Files\r\n\r\nYou can list all the templates you have with\r\n\r\n    re list\r\n\r\nNo explanation needed, hopefully\r\n\r\n#### Deleting Templates\r\n\r\nYou can delete a template with\r\n\r\n    re delete NAME\r\n\r\nAs expected, this is permanent and cannot be undone.\r\n","google":"UA-20915324-3","note":"Don't delete this file!
